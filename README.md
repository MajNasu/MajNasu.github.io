Welcome to Ultimate Card Battle!

If you've ever played a trading card game, or more commonly known as TCG, you'll have some vague familiarity with my game. The point of the game is to destroy the enemy hero by depleting his life points.

Upon landing the page, two players are prompted to choose their hero. Each hero provides their own respective decks from their universe. After picking, players may click on the cards in their hand to put them into play.

Once the minion cards are in play, the player who possesses the minion card may click on his/her minion to initiate attack mode. Then he/she may click an opponent minion or opponent hero. The attacking minion also receives damage equal to the opponent minion's attack value. Minions may only begin attacking after the first round is over.

Players lose when their HP reaches zero.

As of right now, the mechanics of the game are largely imbalanced as Player 2 inherently goes second and can attack second.

Additionally, Draw Cards button does not work.

KNOWN BUGS:
1. A minion can attack another minion and die in the process. Though dead, the attacking player may keep clicking on opponent minions/hero and continuously deplete HP. (Possible fix: unbind click event after attacking minion is removed.)

2. Drawing cards! Because the hand cards were created as 7 divs with the card info being appended, constructing a draw card function is a lot more difficult than naturally believed.
